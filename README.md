# NLP Modeling and Annotation Experiment on 250 Reddit Content
#### Aim: Aim of this experiment was to go through the process of peer annotation and perform logistic regression on it.
#### Tools/Libraries Used: Jupyter Notebook, TfidfVectorizer from SkLearn, Pandas Dataframe, NumPy, and Cross Vadilation from SkLearn. 
#### Other notes: The jupyter notebook contains all the code for this experiment. The excel file contains the raw annotated data, final data for use, and some advanced calculations such as the confusion matrix and Cohhen's Kappa. 

#### Comment on the Accuracy: The accuracy for this experiment is really low considering it has only 250 documents/texts in total for both the training and testing sets. Only 250 documents were selected so that it is easy for my peers to annotate the experiment.
